Identifying Patterns and Trends in Campus Placement Data using Machine Learning
This project report delves into an in-depth analysis of gender-based disparities and various factors influencing placement success within the program. We begin by examining
the performance of male (M) and female (F) students, shedding light on the notable gender imbalance in the scheme. Among male students, the success rate stands at 72%, while
female students achieve a 58% placement rate. To bridge this gap, we recommend a targeted effort to recruit more female students, addressing this imbalance effectively.
Moving beyond gender, our analysis explores several key factors affecting placement success. We delve into the influence of secondary education percentages in both 10th
and 12th grades, uncovering the nuances in their impact on placements. While lower scores in the 10th-grade examination present challenges, some students with scores between
45% and 60% still secure placements. However, over-reliance on grade 10 scores may limit options and discourage students with lower scores.
The 12th-grade examination introduces additional complexities, potentially undermining the university's role in shaping employability. We also investigate the influence of
f the choice of examination boards (Central vs. Others) and find a relatively minor variation in placement rates.
Specialization in higher secondary education emerges as a crucial factor. Science and commerce students demonstrate higher success rates, around 60%, while those specializing in
arts experience a significantly lower success rate of only 33%. Given the limited number of art students, we recommend providing additional support to help them excel in the program.
Higher degree percentages are positively correlated with placement success, emphasizing the significance of academic performance at the university level. Further exploration reveals
that students specializing in Science and Commerce are more likely to secure placements, while those pursuing other fields face challenges.
Work experience proves to be a valuable asset, increasing the likelihood of securing placements. Surprisingly, employability test percentages and MBA percentages exhibit limited impact
on placement success, with students achieving placements across a range of scores.
Our analysis identifies the logistic regression model as the most suitable for predicting placement success. This model excels with a high F1 score for placed students and the ability 
to identify students less likely to secure placements. It offers an opportunity to provide additional support to at-risk students.
In conclusion, this analysis uncovers patterns and disparities in placement success rates. We recommend the university's focus on supporting underrepresented groups, including female 
students and those specializing in less common subjects such as arts. The logistic regression model serves as a valuable tool, but ongoing data collection and system adjustments are essential for accurate predictions as the program evolves.
